# Ad Astra, Per Aspera

### Space, the final frontier. Only recently have we managed to get ourselves to travel far and beyond - towards the dark, starry void. From the very beginning, we have used rockets to travel from the ground up. These rockets are wonderful machines with power so extraordinarily unmatched that with them, we have reached speeds that we thought off as overly idealistic not long ago. With this website, we will briefly learn about rocket history and rocket science through an interactive medium.
