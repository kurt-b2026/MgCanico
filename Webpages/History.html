Goddard also publishes a paper 12 years after (1915) regarding his experiments about liquid oxygen and gasoline as fuel for powering a small rocket successfully.</div>

The name Sputnik was derived from “wayfarer” and was the first artificial satellite to enter the Low Earth Orbit. Its purpose was simple: to test the limits and capabilities of manmade objects in space. It sent signals to the Russian space stations for 3 weeks until its zinc batteries ran out and it lifelessly orbited the planet for 2 months, before falling back down.</div>

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, formally known as NASA, was released due to the rising tension in the Russian-US space race. This administration would move on to make the greatest shuttles and telescopes for traversing and investigating the great beyond.</div>

From July 1962 to November 1963, NASA launched 10 rockets named The Mariners, with one mission: To reach other planets. 3 were able to reach Venus, 4 reached Mars, and 1 was able to get to Mercury. These launches were the first major success the US had over the Russians in the Space Race.</div>

Though NASA is no longer alone in it's space expolrations. The new race for space has also been dominated by other countries, like Roscosmos (Russia) and the ESA (Europe). Private companies have also taken to the skies, like SpaceX, and Boeing. Nobody knows what the future holds, we can only find out...
