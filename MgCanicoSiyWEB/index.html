    <h1>Ad Astra Per Aspera</h1>
    <p class="ex1">Space, the final frontier. Only recently have we managed to get ourselves to travel far and beyond- towards the dark, starry void. From the very beginning, we have used rockets to travel from the ground up. These rockets are wonderful machines with power so extraordinarily unmatched that with them, we have reached speeds that we thought off as overly idealistic not long ago. With this website, we will briefly learn about rocket history and rocket science through an interactive medium. <br><br> We have many wonders for our newest frontier. Vehicles, the explorers, and the journey that they took part in.<br>As a preface, let's go through the vehicles that our greatest minds have created.</p>

      <p>The creation of the conventional "Soyuz Rocket" involved the derivation of the Soviet R-7 Semyorka ICBM originally designed to send nuclear payloads intercontinentally. It was redesigned for the human spaceflight programme of the Soviet Union by chief designer Sergei Korolev. <br><br>Weighing 280 metric tons, the R7 rocket can lift 4 tons into LEO (Low Earth Orbit). <br><br> In October 4, 1957, The R7 rocket lifted the Sputnik satellite into orbit. The launch was a complete success. <br><br> In modern times, the R7 rocket stands as the most reliable rocket ever to be used. It is still launched by the efforts of NASA and Roscosmos (the Russian space agency) today, sending astronauts and cosmonauts to the International Space Station.  </p>

      <h6>Saturn V</h6>

      <p>The Saturn V rocket is a retired, three-stage super-heavy lift vehicle build by NASA and designed by Wernher von Braun to lift payloads to the moon. It had 1 failure during its first crewed flight, with Apollo 1 exploding shortly after launch. <br><br>The Saturn V weighed 3100 tons, carrying a payload of 140 tons to LEO. The Saturn V could also carry 43,500 kg to TLI (trans-lunar injection, the path to the moon). The rocket carried a total of 24 people to the moon. <br><br> Its first stage was the S-IC stage, a kerosene-powered rocket that weighed most of the launch mass. The second stage was the S-II stage, a hydrogen-fuelled rocket that took the Saturn V to orbit high above the atmosphere. The third stage was the S-IVB stage, which was pretty much part of the whole rocket's payload. It carried the astronauts to the moon. 
      <br><br> The Apollo spacecraft slowed the astronauts towards lunar orbit and returned them back to Earth.</p>
