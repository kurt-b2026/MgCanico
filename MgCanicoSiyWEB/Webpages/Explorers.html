      <h1>The Explorers</h1>
      <p>There have been many explorers of space in the history of mankind. In the Soviet Union and the United States,
        their explorers - cosmonauts and astronauts, have touched the edge of space, pierced the atmosphere, and arrived
        at the starry void of the future. We will look at these explorers throughout their wonderful, yet brutal
        journeys. But first, the pioneers - the Soviet Union!</p>
      <h4>Soviet Union</h4>
      <ul>
        <h6><br>Laika the Dog</h6>

        <div><img id="laika" src="../background-images/Explorers-Images/Laika.png" title="Postage stamp of Laika"
            alt="Image of Laika" /></div>

        <div class="image-description">
          <p id="laikadescription">A postage stamp from the Emirate of Ajman showing Laika in space. </p>
        </div>

        <p>Launched in the 3rd of November, 1957 with the Sputnik 2 spacecraft, Laika was launched to a 212 x 1660 km
          orbit around the Earth. After her flight was hastily planned by the Soviet Premiere Nikita Khrushchev to
          coincide with the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, she was sent on a one-way mission to a realm
          that barely any of us are familiar with. Researchers planned for her to die of oxygen deprivation after 7 days
          in space - a painless death taking 15 seconds to complete. There were many problems with her life support
          system, however. She died a few hours after liftoff due to overheating. As it was in the vacuum of space, it
          was rather painless for our animal explorer.</p>

        <h6><br>The Pioneer: Yuri Gagarin</h6>

        <div><img id="yuri1" src="../background-images/Explorers-Images/Yuri1.png" title="A Very Happy Yuri Gagarin"
            alt="Yuri feeling something 200% of us don't feel" />
          <div class="image-description">
            <p id="yuri1description">A very happy Yuri Gagarin. </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div><img id="yuri2" src="../background-images/Explorers-Images/Yuri2.png" title="Art of Yuri"
            alt="Art of Yuri Gagarin" />
          <div class="image-description">
            <p id="yuri2description">Art of Yuri Gagarin </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Yuri Gagarin, the most famous cosmonaut, the first man in space, the first man to orbit the Earth, the man
          with the many "firsts". Yuri is a living legend among the men and women that have interacted with the void of
          space. His flight, the Vostok-1, was launched on April 12, 1961. It was carried by the mighty Vostok-K 8K72K
          rocket, a variation of the R7 rocket designed by the Soviet Chief Engineer Sergei Korolev. In LEO (Low Earth
          Orbit), his spacecraft skimmed 169 kilometers above the Earth's surface. After one orbit, his spacecraft,
          flying high above Africa, deorbited towards Earth reentry. After a few minutes of the gruelling reentry, he
          was 7 kilometers above a Soviet farm in the village of Smelovka when a farmer and her granddaughter saw him
          descend. He later recalled: <br>
          "When they saw me in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as I walked, they started to back away
          in fear. I told them, don't be afraid, I am a Soviet citizen like you, who has descended from space and I must
          find a telephone to call Moscow!"</p>

        <h6><br>The Inspiration: Valentina Tereshkova</h6>

        <div><img id="yuri1" src="../background-images/Explorers-Images/Valentina.png"
            title="A photo of Valentina before liftoff" alt="Legend Valentina Tereshkova" />
          <div class="image-description">
            <p id="valentinadescription">A photo of Valentina before liftoff </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p> Valentina, the first woman in space, and a champion of women all around the world. Tereshkova was the first,
          and the youngest, woman to reach the starry void. Vostok-6, her flight, was launched on June 16, 1963 - two
          years after her male comrade Yuri. Her flight was also carried by the Vostok-K 8K72K rocket. In LEO (Low Earth
          Orbit), she was roughly at the same altitude as Yuri Gagarin on his historic flight. One notable occurence
          during orbit was the fact that Soviet Engineers gave her food, water, and toothpaste - except for a
          toothbrush. After 48 orbits, her spacecraft deorbited towards Earth. After her gruelling reentry, she landed
          in a village 277 kilometers above Moscow. Her flight was the final Vostok flight. Later in life, she said:
          <br>
          "Anyone who has spent any time in space will love it for the rest of their lives." Indeed, she was a legend.
        </p>

        <h6><br>The Second: Gherman Titov</h6>

        <div><img id="titov" src="../background-images/Explorers-Images/Titov.png" title="A photo of Titov"

          </div>
        </div>

        <p> Titov, the second man in space, the successor of Yuri Gagarin. Titov was 26 years old when he entered the
          void of space. Vostok-2, his flight, was launched on August 6, 1961, 8 months after his comrade Yuri. His
          flight was also carried by the Vostok-K 8K72K. In LEO (Low Earth Orbit), he was the first man to experience
          sickness in-flight. Titov was also the first photographer in space. He took the first manual photographs of
          Earth in the Vostok-2. After 25 hours, his spacecraft deorbited towards Earth. After the final stage of
          reentry, he landed in the town of Krasny Kut. His flight was the second Vostok flight. He famously said: <br>
          "I am here up high, and I have yet to see God's face."</p>
      </ul>

      <h4><br>United States of America</h4>

      <p>The Soviets had almost every "first". They were the first to go to space, send an animal to space, send a man
        to space, go send a satellite to the moon, go to Venus, go to Mars, etc. But the Americans one-upped the Soviets
        on one thing: The Moon. The United States aso had very impressive men who reached the void of space. Let us
        honor these heroes.</p>

      <ul>
        <h6>The Visionary: John Glenn</h6>

        <div><img id="yuri1" src="../background-images/Explorers-Images/John_Glenn.png" title="John Glenn in 1998"

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>John Glenn's first flight was carried by the Mercury-Atlas mission. He personally named his spacecraft the
          Friendship 7. His flight was made and operated by NASA under the Project Mercury. In space, he orbited the
          Earth 3 times before reentering. In reentry, Glenn reportedly described the buidup of gasses as a "real
          fireball outside". After 5 hours of launch, his drogue and main parachutes deployed at 28,000 and 10,800 feet
          respectively. Afterwards, he landed near the waters of the Turks and Caicos Islands - specificallly in the
          Grand Turk. The US Government appointed him as a National Hero. <br><br>During the flight, he famously
          said:<br> "Boy, feels like I'm going halfway back to Hawaii!" </p>

        <h6><br>The Moonman: Neil Armstrong</h6>

        <div><img id="neil" src="../background-images/Explorers-Images/Neil_Armstrong.png"
            title="Neil Armstrong in the moon" alt="First American in the Moon" />

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Neil Armstrong is the first human being to step on the moon, doing so in July 20, 1969 after 3 days of
          trans-lunar transit. His flight, the Saturn V,carried the Apollo 11 spacecraft - which, after the Apollo 1
          disaster and the Apollo 8 and Apollo 10 rehearsals, landed on the moon near the Sea of Tranquility, a massive
          flatland in the lunar surface (black spots of the moon that you can see). Neil Armstrong flew the X-15
          rocketplane betwee November 30, 1960 and July 26, 1962. Nevertheless, the Apollo 11 mission launched in July
          16, 1969 at 9:32 PM GMT+8. His Saturn V spacecraft was designed by engineer and NASA administrator Wernher von
          Braun. Upon LEO, he orbited the Earth in a circular orbit 190 kilometers above the surface. Upon moon arrival
          and reorbit, he was in a 110 kilometer moon orbit. He landed. After 2 days of staying on the moon, him and
          Buzz Aldrin lit the upper stage of their LEM (Lunar Excursion Module - the lander) to return to the Apollo 11
          CSM (the pointy rocket that stayed in orbit). They returned to Earth after 8 days in July 24, 1969, splashing
          down 1,400 kilometers north-west of Hawaii. They were immediately put on quarantine for "possible lunar
          diseases" (which was awfully possible, as proven by the existence and survival of tardigrades in the vacuum of
          space). <br>After the legendary lunar landing attempt, and as he stepped on the moon, he uttered: "That's one
          small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"</p>
